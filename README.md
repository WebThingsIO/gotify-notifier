# gotify-notifier

A simple WebThings Gateway notifier for sending push notifications through a
self-hosted Gotify server.

## Setup

Log in to your Gotify server, add a new app, then copy the token.

### Installation and Configuration

On your gateway, navigate to _Settings -> Add-ons_. Next, click the plus (+)
button and scroll down to install the Gotify Notifier.

With the notifier installed, click "Configure", then input the token you just
created and your server.

Now, you can go create some rules and use Gotify as a notification output.
